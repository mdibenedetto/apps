I also negotiated with stakeholders to defer non-essential features.\n\n**Result**: We launched on time with 95% of planned features. The remaining 5% shipped two weeks later. Post-launch bugs were 40% lower than our previous release."

We agreed to test both approaches with production-like data.\n\n**Result**: The data showed my approach was 30% faster, but theirs was more maintainable. We combined both: my indexing strategy with their schema design. We now collaborate effectively and built a better solution together."
